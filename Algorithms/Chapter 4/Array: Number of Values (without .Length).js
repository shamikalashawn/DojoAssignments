/* Without using the .length property that is present on all arrays, determine and return the number of values in the given array. If we were to do this on a numerical array, we might check to see whether the element at a certain numerical index was undefined. Unfortunately, we can't do that here because the keys don't have any sort of predictable order or first value.

So, for object {band: "Travis Shredd & the Good Ol' Homeboys", style: "Country/Metal/Rap", album: "668: The Neighbor of the Beast" } you should return the value 3, because there are three keys in this object: band, style and album.
