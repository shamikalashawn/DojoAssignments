/*
This is based on “Flexible Countdown”. The parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is essentially identical; don’t be thrown off! Given 4 parameters (param1,param2,param3,param4), print the multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, then skip (don’t print) that one. Do this using a WHILE loop.

Example: Given (3,5,17,9), print 6,12,15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, except for the value 9).

function countDown(param1, param2, param3, param4) {
  while (param2 <= param3){
    if (param2 == param4) {
      param2 ++;
      continue;
    } else if (param2 % param1 == 0) {
      console.log(param2);
    }
    param2 ++;
  }
}
